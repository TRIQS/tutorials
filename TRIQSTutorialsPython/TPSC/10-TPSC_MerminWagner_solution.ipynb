    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mermin-Wagner theorem states that a continuous-symmetry cannot be broken at finite temperature in two dimensions. So, antiferromagnetism is impossible in two dimensions, contrary to the prediction of RPA. Here is a heuristic proof. Assume that the spins are collinear in the $z$ direction. Then the free energy density contains a term proportional to $(\\nabla S^z)^2/2$. In Fourier space, this becomes $-q^2|S^z(\\mathbf{q})|^2/2$. In the long wavelength limit, where fluctuations are slow, we can use the classical equipartition theorem so that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$|S^z(\\mathbf{q})|^2=\\frac{k_BT}{q^2}$$. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the local moment diverges because of an infrared divergence\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\left<(S^z)^2\\right>\\sim \\int d^2q |S^z(\\mathbf{q})|^2\\sim \\int d^2q\\frac{k_BT}{q^2}=\\infty$$. \n",
    "\n",
    "We come to an absurdity, which proves that the hypothesis is wrong, there is no long-range order. \n",
    "\n",
    "To see that TPSC satisfies the Mermin-Wagner theorem, first note that the spin susceptibility has the following spectrral representation\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\chi_{sp}(\\mathbf{q},i\\omega_n)=\\int\\frac{d\\omega}{\\pi}\\frac{\\chi_{sp}''(\\mathbf{q},\\omega)}{\\omega-i\\omega_n}=\\int\\frac{d\\omega}{\\pi}\\frac{\\chi_{sp}''(\\mathbf{q},\\omega)\\omega}{\\omega^2+(\\omega_n)^2}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The last equality follows from the fact $\\chi_{sp}''(\\mathbf{q},\\omega)$ is odd in frequency. This last result shows that the finite Matsubara frequencies should be regular. The largest contribution is the zero-Matsubara frequency one. This allows us to give a rough idea of why the theorem is satisfied by focusing on the zero Matsubara frequency contribution. \n",

Since the right-hand side is finite, $\\xi$ adjusts itself not to become infinite, otherwise the left-hand side diverges. The divergence of the susceptibility can occur only at $T=0$ where we cannot treat the non-zero Matsubara frequencies separately. \n",

    "There seems to be a finite transition temperature even for TPSC. If there is a numerical problem leading to that, can you identify it?\n",

    "## Answer \n",
    "\n",
    "The zero-Matsubara frequency contribution to the local moment sum-rule is a logarithmically divergent integral when the correlation length is infinite. Since the right-hand side of the sum-rule is finite, the correlation length is forced to remain finite. If the momentum mesh is discrete and does not include $0$, the discrete numerical integral converges even for an infinite correlation length, so there is a finite transition temperature. See the remarks below for how to solve this problem. It amounts to basically doing a careful analysis of the asymptotic behavior, subtracting this asymptotic behavior in the numerical integral and adding the analytical expression for the asymptotic part.   \n",

    "## Remarks\n",
    "* To evaluate the integrals and sums entering the sum rules accurately, one must use several tricks that are described in appendix B of this [paper](https://journals.aps.org/prb/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevB.53.14236).\n",
    "* The asymptotic behavior of the self-consistency equation is done in a more rigorous way as an intermediate step in this [discussion of the critical behavior](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1209/0295-5075/84/37013/meta).\n",
    "* $U_{sp}$ vanishing as $T->0$ is unphysical. It is a consequence of the fact that to avoid the phase transition, $U_{sp}$ must be smaller than the mean-field value $$ U_c^{(RPA)} = \\frac{2}{\\chi_0(\\mathbf{k}_{AF}, 0)} $$ which is zero at $T=0$ because the susceptibility diverges there for the perfectly nested Fermi surface.\n",
    "* The results can be trusted at temperatures not too far below the rapid crossover in the renormalized classical regime where $\\xi$ starts to grow exponentially. In particular, the sudden fall of $U_{sp}$ around $T=0.5$ is seen by other methods in this [comment](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.90.099702).\n",
    "* The internal consistency condition $Tr[\\Sigma G]=2U\\left< n_\\uparrow n_\\downarrow \\right>$ can be used to estimate the domain of validity of the approach.                                                                  "
