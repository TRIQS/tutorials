    "A first DMFT calculation\n",
    "========================\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to make a first DMFT calculation using the iterated perturbation theory (IPT) to solve the impurity problem.\n",
    "You will proceed in two steps: first you will set up the IPT\n",
    "impurity solver and then you will set up the DMFT loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The iterated perturbation theory\n",
    "--------------------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The IPT is a cheap way to solve the impurity problem which is restricted\n",
    "to half-filling. It approximates the self-energy by second-order\n",
    "perturbation theory, just like in the last exercise of the notebook\n",
    "on Green's functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\Sigma(i\\omega_n) = \\frac{U}{2} + U^2 \\int_0^\\beta d\\tau e^{i \\omega_n \\tau} G_0(\\tau)^3 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the first term, $\\frac{U}{2}$, is the chemical potential $\\mu$ for half-filling.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1\n",
    "\n",
    "An impurity solver takes a non-interacting Green's function $G_0$\n",
    "as an input and returns the interacting Green's function $G$ as well as the\n",
    "self-energy $\\Sigma$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that takes $U$, $\\beta$ and $G_0(i\\omega)$ as an input and returns\n",
    "$G(i\\omega)$ and $\\Sigma(i\\omega)$. If you are more familiar with python, you can write a `Solver`\n",
    "class, constructed with $\\beta$ and with a member `solve` returning $G$ and\n",
    "$\\Sigma$ after the class member `G0` is initialized. The advantage of using a class\n",
    "is that Green's functions will not have to be constructed at every call of the\n",
    "function `solve`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the IPT only works at half-filling, use the convention $\\mu=0$; then, the spectral function will be symmetric around $\\omega=0$. This also means that the first term in the IPT equation for $\\Sigma(i\\omega)$ is zero."
